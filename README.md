# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, aiming to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## 📂 Project Overview

Using Python and the popular `scikit-learn` library, this notebook walks through the complete process of:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Logistic Regression)
- Model Evaluation
- Making Predictions

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Dataset

The dataset is the classic Titanic dataset from [Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab).
3. Run each cell step-by-step to understand the data flow and model predictions.

## 📊 Results

- Achieved a decent prediction accuracy using logistic regression.
- Feature importance analysis showed that factors like gender, passenger class, and age play a key role in survival chances.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Implement advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or SVM.
- Use hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) for better performance.
- Add visualization dashboards.
